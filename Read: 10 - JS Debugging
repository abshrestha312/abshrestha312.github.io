Read: 10 - JS Debugging
Summary:
Error Handling & Debugging:
1.	Programmer should know the order of execution of the code to find the source of error.
2.	Execution Context:
a.	Every statement in a script lives in one of three execution contexts.
i.	Global Context:
1.	Code that is in the script, but not in a function.
ii.	Function Context:
1.	Code that is being run within a function.
iii.	Eval Context:
1.	Text is executed like code in an internal function called eval().
3.	Variable Scope:
a.	The first two execution contexts correspond with the notion of scope.
i.	Global Scope: Variable declared outside a function has global scope.
ii.	Function-Level Scope: Variable declared inside a function can only be used inside the function because it has function-level scope.
4.	Debugging is the process of finding Errors.
5.	Console helps to narrow down the area of error.
6.	try, catch, finally statements can be used to handle the errors.
7.	JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. They give us the line number and a description of the error.
