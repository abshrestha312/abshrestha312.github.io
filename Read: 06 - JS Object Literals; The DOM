Document Object Model:
	DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
1.	The browser represents the page using a DOM tree that consists of four different types of nodes. They are document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
2.	Element nodes can be selected by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
3.	Nodelist is always returned whenever a DOM query returns more than one node.
4.	An Element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
5.	DOM manipulation techniques or properties like textContent and innerHTML can be used to access and update the content of an element node.
6.	DOM tree can be viewed in the browsers.
