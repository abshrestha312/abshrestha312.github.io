Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

SUMMARY:

TRANSFORM:

1.  CSS3 introduced new ways to position and alter elements.
2.  All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
3. transform property comes in two settings, two dimensional and. three dimensional. Each has its own individual properties and values.
4. Following is the example of transform syntax. (transform property followed by the value)
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

TRANSITIONS & ANIMATIONS:

1.  CSS3 gives us ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
2.  Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes.
3.  Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
4.  The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
5.  There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.
6.  A handful of the more popular transitional properties include the following.

background-color      background-position       border-color      border-width      border-spacing      bottom            clip            color
